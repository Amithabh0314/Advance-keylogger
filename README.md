# 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how endpoint monitoring techniques can be implemented for:
Security research
Malware behavior simulation
Red-team / blue-team lab exercises
Understanding attack vectors
Defensive detection testing

# It simulates common post-exploitation behaviors so defenders can:
Analyze detection gaps
Improve EDR rules
Test monitoring systems
Study attacker techniques safely

# 🎯 Educational Objectives
Understand how endpoint monitoring works
Learn about:
Threading in Python
SMTP / IMAP communication
Encryption using Fernet
File handling & logging
Webcam and microphone access APIs

Study how malicious software operates to build better defenses

# 🧠 Features (For Authorized Lab Simulation)

Encrypted data handling
Email-based command processing (lab testing)
Screenshot capture (authorized environment)
Webcam capture (consent required)
Audio recording (consent required)
Multi-threaded execution
Periodic reporting
Secure key generation

# 🔐Security & Encryption

The project uses:
cryptography.fernet for symmetric encryption
Encrypted key storage
Secure SMTP (SSL) connection
This demonstrates how attackers may attempt to hide data — useful for defensive research.
